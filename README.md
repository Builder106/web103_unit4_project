About this web app: **Sole Story is a custom sneaker designer where users pick upper, sole, laces, and trim, see live icon and price updates, and save, edit, or delete pairs in a PostgreSQL-backed collection.**

Time spent: **8** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The web app uses React to display data from the API.**
- [x] **The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured `CustomItem` table.**
  - [x]  **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a view of your Render dashboard demonstrating that your Postgres database is available**
  - [x]  **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a demonstration of your table contents. Use the psql command 'SELECT * FROM tablename;' to display your table contents.**
- [x] **Users can view **multiple** features of the `CustomItem` (e.g. car) they can customize, (e.g. wheels, exterior, etc.)**
- [x] **Each customizable feature has multiple options to choose from (e.g. exterior could be red, blue, black, etc.)**

## Notes

The backend includes a `db:reset` script to create the `custom_items` table and a `db:seed` script to insert sample pairs when the table is empty (run `npm run db:reset` then `npm run db:seed` after configuring `server/.env`).
